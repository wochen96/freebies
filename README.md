## Mission Statement

Our mission is to help students take advantage of the free resources that the UW campus provides.

## Problem Statement

Students, especially Freshmen upon coming to UW, are unaware of the free resources that the campus provides that are available to them. The free resources help reduce additional cost for students who are living in a frugal fashion to maintain their financial budgets. Information regarding these resources are often scattered on different platforms, making it difficult to find. To get the most out of college life, resources that do not require additional money spending should be taken advantage of because tuition and living expenses are already expensive enough. Taking advantage of these resources will save them a lot of money and give them a head start on their education at UW. To solve the problem, our mission is to help students navigate all the resources that UW campus has to offer.
